## Projects

Here are some of my best and most worked on projects.

- <a href="https://www.github.com/joee9/spotifystats">`spotifystats`</a>
    - a program to allow a Spotify user to collect their personal listening data, and receive daily, monthly, and yearly updates on their overall listening history and patterns via email.
    - written in pure Python, this code writes `html` containing images, links, etc. and sends them in an enriched email, making the experience feel interactive.
